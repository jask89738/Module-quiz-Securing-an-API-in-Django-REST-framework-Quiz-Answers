Question 1)
In what way can you validate the price field to not be less than 5 in a serializer? Choose all that apply.

By using a validation method
By using a validate_price_lt method
By adding this line of code in the serializer:

price = serializers.DecimalField(max_digits=6, decimal_places=2, min_value=5)
By adding

‘price’: {‘min_value’: 2} in the extra_kwargs section
By using a validate method
 

Question 2)
How can you limit an API endpoint in such a way that only POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE calls will be throttled, but GET calls will not be throttled? Choose all that apply.

This cannot be done
By writing a scoped throttle class and set it up in the settings.py file
By writing a custom throttle class and overriding the get_throttles method
By writing a custom throttle class and using it inside a @throttle_classes decorator.
Question 3)
For token-based authentication, you need to install the Djoser library because DRF doesn’t support such authentications by default.

True
False
Question 4)
How can you enable support for sorting the API output by two fields: age and gender?

By manually parsing the query string
By adding this line of code
ordering_fields=[‘age’,’gender’] in a class-based view
By adding this @ordering_fields([‘age’,’gender’]) above a function-based view
No code change is required. Just add ‘OrderingFilter’ in the settings.py file and DRF will process it automatically.
Question 5)
Which of the following are valid endpoints automatically created by Djoser?

/user/confirm/
/user/
/users/
/user/me/
/users/me/
Question 6)

It also blacklists the access token
It cannot be used to generate new access tokens anymore.
It expires
It blocks the user who bears this token
It cannot be used to generate new refresh tokens
Question 10)
